### Meetings
During the school year, the VPI Club has weekly meetings every **Friday** at **7pm** in **Smyth Hall 146**. The club meets only when the university is in session, and does not have formal meetings in the summer or winter. Outside of meetings, the club hangs out, plans cave trips, and sows chaos on the platforms listed below.

### Instagram
[@vpi.caveclub](https://www.instagram.com/vpi.caveclub/?hl=en) for trip pics, updates, and the occasional meme.

### Email List
