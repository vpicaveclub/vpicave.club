### Meetings
During the school year, the VPI Club has weekly meetings every **Friday** at **7pm** in **Torgersen Hall 1020**. The club meets only when the university is in session, and does not have formal meetings in the summer or winter. Outside of meetings, the club hangs out, plans cave trips, and causes riffraff on the platforms listed below.

### Instagram
