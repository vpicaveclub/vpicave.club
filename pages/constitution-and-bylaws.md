The Constitution of our club contains all the basic rules for operation of the club as an organization. The Constitution also contains the guidelines we follow to remain safe underground and protect our fragile environment.

The current version of the constitution was adopted on March 12, 2021. This update removed the outdated membership requirement of carbide lamp knowledge, strengthed policy regarding members expelled for misconduct, and added a section specifying operations in the event of emergencies like pandemics.
