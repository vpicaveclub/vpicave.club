# About

The VPI Cave Club strives to promote interest in and advance the science of speleology, to promote conservation of caves and safety in their exploration, and to encourage fellowship among Virginia Tech students and alumni interested in caving.

Here in the heart of Appalachia, our club turns a relatively niche activity into a hobby and passion for a total of 500 members and counting (active and alumni)! There are many caves to visit within a short drive from the Virginia Tech campus.

We do all kinds of cave tripsâ€”including (but not limited to) horizontal caving, vertical caving, sport caving, research caving, and surveying. Each cave trip offers a different experience, so there's something for everyone. Some are more difficult than others, but we're happy to help prospective members learn the ropes! (no pun intended)

With the club, you can explore this fascinating underground world and learn how to enjoy this hobby safely and with respect to the cave environment.

# Meetings

In normal semesters, the VPI Cave Club meets on Friday evenings at 7:00pm in **Torgersen 1020** on the Virginia Tech campus. The club meets when the university is in session, and normally does not have summer or winter meetings.

We highly encourage prospective members to attend one of these meetings. There is no prerequisite for joining, or coming to a meeting!
