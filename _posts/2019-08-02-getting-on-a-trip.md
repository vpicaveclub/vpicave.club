# Go Caving

The best way to get on a trip with us is to attend one of our meetings. Information about this can be found on our [home page]({% link index.md %}).

The trip leader will tell you what to bring, what to wear, and where to meet for the trip. On your first few trips we will provide you with a helmet and a helmet-mounted light.

Our beginner trips usually set out Saturday or Sunday morning from Smythe 146. Although beginner trips usually spend only a few hours underground, plan to be gone most of the afternoon; if everyone’s having a great time, you might stay underground longer. If the trip leader is planning a trip which is particularly short or long, you’ll know in advance.

# Can't Attend a Meeting?

Please contact the club’s [vice president](mailto:vp@vpicaveclub.org). The vice president will make sure you know about scheduled trips and how you can join the fun.

# Scouts and Youth Groups

We do occasionally take scouts, outdoor groups, and youth groups caving. More information about this can be found on our [group trips]({% link _posts/2019-08-02-group-trips.md %}) page.
